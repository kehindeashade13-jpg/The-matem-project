    excerpt: 'Our Primary 5 pupils emerged overall winners in the regional STEM exhibition with their solar energy prototype project.',
    content: `We are thrilled to announce that Matem Private School has clinched the first position at the annual Lagos Regional Primary Science and STEM Exhibition!

Our brilliant Primary 5 representatives—Chidi, Amina, and Tunde—presented an innovative, working prototype of a "Solar-Powered Clean Water Purifier for Rural Communities." The judges praised their deep understanding of renewable energy and their practical problem-solving skills.

At Matem, we believe in hands-on learning. This victory is a testament to the dedication of our excellent teaching staff and the curious minds of our pupils. 

"We wanted to build something that could help villages get clean water using just the sun," said Chidi during his presentation.

Congratulations to the pupils, their parents, and our science coordinator, Mrs. Sarah Alabi! We are incredibly proud of this milestone.`,
